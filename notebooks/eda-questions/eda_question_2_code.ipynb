    "# Justification of Visualization:\n",
    "\n",
    "# The visualization reveals a weak-to-nonexistent correlation between a province's median 24-hour rainfall and its total cumulative budget for flood control projects. The regression line is nearly horizontal, suggesting that as environmental threat increases, the allocated \"mitigation\" budget does not necessarily scale in proportion.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Key Insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Mismatch in Prioritization: We observe several \"budget outliers\" where provinces with moderate rainfall (100–150 mm) have received funding exceeding 40 billion pesos, while provinces facing extreme typical rainfall (above 250 mm) remain at the lower end of the funding spectrum.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Conclusion on EDA question 2: The data reveals a significant misalignment between environmental threat and infrastructure investment; the nearly flat regression line in the analysis proves that median rainfall is not a predictor of cumulative funding. This \"prioritization mismatch\" suggests that resource allocation is likely driven by socio-economic or political factors rather than meteorological risk, leaving high-threat provinces potentially under-protected."
